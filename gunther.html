G&uumlnther is well-known Swedish pleasureman. Before he started working as an artist, he worked part time in a clothing store. Gunther's 2004 smash hit "Ding Dong Song" brought him country-wide recognition in his homeland, Sweden. The campy, silly, and titillating track, "Ding Dong Song" topped the Swedish charts the year of its release thanks to an inescapable hook and a sexually charged video featuring G&uumlnther's backup singers, the Sunshine Girls. A year later the campy phenomenon spread across Europe as indie rockers Franz Ferdinand were heard performing the song acoustically on Dutch radio. In 2006, his song "Like Fire Tonight" was accepted into Melodifestivalen, a Swedish music competition. However, G&uumlnther and the Sunshine Girls finished sixth in the semi-final round and did not make the finals. G&uumlnther announced on his website that he is currently working on a new album with the working title Dirty Man Swedish Sex Beast. In 2011, the first single, "Pussycat", became available on G&uumlnther's web site. Coming back from a hiatus, G&uumlnther released the single "I'm Not Justin Bieber, B*tch" on December 12, 2013.
